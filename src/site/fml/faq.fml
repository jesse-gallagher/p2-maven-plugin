            <question>
                What is p2-maven-plugin?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    This is an easy-to-use Maven3 plugin responsible for the automation of dependency management in the Eclipse RCP
                    environment.
                    Basically what it does is downloading dependencies, transforming them to OSGi bundles (if required) and generating
                    a P2 update site.
